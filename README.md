## üåü How it works

[`AutoHotKey`](https://www.autohotkey.com/) Runs the script in the background and listens for hotkeys. When a hotkey is pressed, the script runs the corresponding function.

## üì¶ Installation and Usage

### AutoHotKey

Make sure you have `AHK` installed on your machine.
If you don't have `AHK` installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

### Start the script

Once you have `AHK` installed, you can start the script by `double clicking` on the `.AHK` file.

## üí∞ Usage

### `EncryptedTextFile.ahk`

This creates a file that is encrypted with AxCrypt in a specific location.

### `OpenShell.ahk`

This opens a `powershell` instance in the specific location you are browsing in `file explorer` using `ctrl+shift+p`.
